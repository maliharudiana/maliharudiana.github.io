Today, 8th of August, 2020. There is no sign of COVID-19 crisis to be abating. Just how naively it started and how wrecking it is now. Count of infected 480+ and along with
deaths. As per current Stage 4 lockdown rules, we can't go in pair for walk or essential shopping, only one is allowed. So, means, no couple outing, even for exercise.
Exercise time is stripped to 1 hour per day.

We are happy to endure this temporary annoyance for the sake of better days. I hope people would comply for the sake of people. We can't just be selfish at present and
annhilate our future. That would be so blinsighted thing to do.

So, Melbourne, pull yourself together. You have it!!!
