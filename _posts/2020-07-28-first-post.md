This is the Hello World, I guess. It is exciting to put myself out there and express myself in my own space. It is really like a microphone, a bit muted one, I will say. But I have got the floor to tell everyone and I am the speaker.

Also, this site is my first trial to use the Github Pages platform to publish. This is really good to be find myself educated in how to version a personal site, take full advantage of static site generator and then have it hosted on Github.

Looking forward to see find my motication to write posts in future.
